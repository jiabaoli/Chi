# Chi
Learn and practice master guided Tai Chi in tranquil virtual environment
Tai Chi is an exquisite martial art form that revives the body and the mind.
For the first time, practitioners can learn and benefit from this ancient practice through immersion in virtual reality.
Practitioners are transported into a tranquil outdoor virtual environment that evokes a sense of peace.
Guided by a Tai Chi master recorded with a tracking sensor, their movements are reinforced through real-time animated visual cues and a tactile training garment.
These elements all combine to illustrate the abstract concept of “Chi” - the flow of energy, and form an integrative experience eliciting new appreciations to the practice of Tai Chi.
